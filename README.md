# IMPORTANT NOTICE
As of 7/5/2023 I will no longer be doing changes or commits to the .NET Framework version of BnS-Multi-Tool. I will instead be transitioning it to .NET 6+ and I have not yet decided how I will treat this repo, I will most likely archive it and start a new one.

The .NET 6+ version will have most of the code rewriten, optimized while utilizing standard practices like mvvm pattern and dependency injection. When I started multi-tool I was just getting back into programming after a very long hiatus from it and just wanted to throw stuff at a wall and see if it stuck. I have been wanting to move to .NET 6 for a variety of reasons, most importantly being the performance improvements over .NET Framework but I kept putting it off because I told myself if I am going to make such a big move it should be done right for something that is as popular as it is. I've slowly been working on it for a little over a year when I am bored and have time and I am getting close to where it's done so yeah.. wanted to update the repo and give a heads up.
