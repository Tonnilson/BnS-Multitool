# BnS-Multitool
Multi-tool for managing bns mod related stuff

This is just the source code, you can download the compiled one at: http://multitool.tonic.pw/

# IMPORTANT NOTICE
As of 7/5/2023 I will no longer be doing changes or commits to the .NET Framework version of BnS-Multi-Tool. I will instead be transitioning it to .NET 6+ and I have not yet decided how I will treat this repo, I will most likely archive it and start a new one.
